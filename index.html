            <p>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s
                incredibly rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for
                what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

            <p>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and
                our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come
                from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the
                skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
